# sunwil0_Lab1

Developed with Unreal Engine 4


# Task 5: Reflection

This lab got me familiar in how to use unreal engine for the first time, as well as how to make it work with git. The hardest part of it was to get git working smoothly and it took a couple tries until I had it set up the way I wanted it.

Overall the lab was straightforward and taught what it was supposed to.

I estimate I spent around 3-4 hours on this lab, most of that being troubleshooting the missing modules error.
